# SecureRoll: Enhancing Blockchain Rollups Security and Reliability

Our study is driven by the pressing need to tackle security concerns in off-chain solutions, which promise higher transaction rates but lack adequate security measures. The exposure of sensitive data during off-chain transactions raises significant privacy and security risks, compelling us to explore improved solutions for bolstering data protection in blockchain systems. Our focus is on discovering a security solution for off-chain layer protocols, with a specific emphasis on the scaling technique known as ZK-Rollups. By harnessing ZK (Zero-Knowledge) technologies in smart contracts, we aim to mitigate the issue of sensitive data exposure, ensuring that transactions are validated without compromising confidentiality, thus significantly enhancing privacy and security within the blockchain ecosystem.

As a work in progress, this project has been initiated as part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the prestigious Florida International University, College of Engineering and Computing: Analytics for Cyber Defense (ACyD) Lab.

# ZK-Rollups: Enriching Blockchain Security and Reliability

Welcome to the "ZK-Rollups: Enriching Blockchain Security and Reliability" GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to developing a cutting-edge system aimed at fortifying privacy and security in blockchain transactions through the utilization of smart contracts. Our primary focus is on harnessing the power of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups, an advanced cryptographic technique, to create a robust and efficient layer-two scaling solution. By implementing ZK-Rollups, our objective is to establish a secure framework that protects sensitive information and addresses potential security vulnerabilities within blockchain networks.

As a work in progress, this project has been initiated as part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the prestigious Florida International University, College of Engineering and Computing: Analytics for Cyber Defense (ACyD) Lab.
